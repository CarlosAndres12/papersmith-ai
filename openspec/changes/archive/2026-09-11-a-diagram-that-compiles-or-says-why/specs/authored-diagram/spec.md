# Authored Diagram Specification

## Purpose

An authored diagram is a standalone TikZ source under `paper/Figures/<id>.tex`,
compiled with `latexmk` and reachable from `main.tex` through
`\includegraphics`. This spec pins the compile contract, the bounded repair
ledger, the toolchain/package refusals, the data-figure boundary, and the test
evidence a no-skip suite must produce. Component and caption checks against
contract obligations are `diagram-obligation`'s spec, not this one.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Source Layout

Each diagram id MUST resolve to `paper/Figures/<id>.tex`, a sibling
`<id>.diagram.json` manifest, and (once compiled) `<id>.pdf`; build scratch
lives under `paper/.paper-writing/figures/<id>/`. `main.tex` receives the
figure only through the existing `substitute` verb's `\includegraphics`; no
TikZ byte enters `main.tex`.

#### Scenario: Manifest without source refuses

- GIVEN `<id>.diagram.json` exists with no matching `<id>.tex`
- WHEN `render` runs for that id
- THEN it refuses `DIAGRAM_SOURCE_ABSENT` naming the id

### Requirement: Standalone Compile

`render` MUST invoke `latexmk -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode`
exactly once per call against the standalone `<id>.tex`, and MUST parse `!`
errors and `Overfull \hbox` warnings out of the log back to source lines.

#### Scenario: A clean compile produces the PDF

- GIVEN a syntactically valid `<id>.tex`
- WHEN `render` runs
- THEN exactly one `latexmk` invocation occurs and `<id>.pdf` is written

#### Scenario: An error is mapped to its source line

- GIVEN an `<id>.tex` with an undefined control sequence on a known line
- WHEN `render` runs and the compile fails
- THEN the refusal names that exact source line from the log

### Requirement: Toolchain Absence Refusal

`render` MUST refuse `LATEX_TOOLCHAIN_ABSENT`, naming the binary sought and
the searched `PATH`, when `latexmk` cannot be located. This MUST NOT degrade
to a skip or a silent pass.

#### Scenario: Empty PATH refuses by name

- GIVEN `PATH` contains no `latexmk`
- WHEN `render` runs
- THEN it refuses `LATEX_TOOLCHAIN_ABSENT` naming `latexmk` and the searched `PATH`

### Requirement: Package Absence Spends Nothing

A missing `.sty` reported by the log MUST refuse `LATEX_PACKAGE_ABSENT` naming
the package, and MUST NOT consume a repair-budget attempt — redrawing cannot
fix an absent package.

#### Scenario: Missing package refuses without spending budget

- GIVEN a log reporting a missing package and three attempts already spent
- WHEN `render` classifies the failure as package absence
- THEN it refuses `LATEX_PACKAGE_ABSENT` and the ledger's spent count is unchanged

### Requirement: Repair Budget Ledger

Each figure id MUST hold a repair ledger allowing four `latexmk` compiles;
editing the source between attempts MUST NOT reset the count. A fifth
attempt MUST refuse `REPAIR_BUDGET_SPENT`, naming every distinct diagnostic
and every source digest tried, cleared only by an explicit operator
acknowledgement.

#### Scenario: The budget survives edits between attempts

- GIVEN four failed compiles for one id, each preceded by a source edit
- WHEN a fifth compile is requested
- THEN it refuses `REPAIR_BUDGET_SPENT` naming all four diagnostics and digests

#### Scenario: Acknowledgement clears the ledger

- GIVEN a spent ledger for one id
- WHEN an operator issues the explicit acknowledgement
- THEN the id's ledger resets to zero and a new compile is accepted

### Requirement: Data-Figure Boundary

`render` MUST refuse `DIAGRAM_PLOTS_DATA` when the source loads a plotting
package, reads an external table, or embeds a coordinate series. Independently,
a compile MUST fail when no path from the source reaches any results tree.
Placing a measured figure MUST use a separate verb that compiles nothing and
requires provenance naming the run that produced it.

#### Scenario: A plotting package refuses before compiling

- GIVEN a diagram source that `\usepackage{pgfplots}`
- WHEN `render` runs
- THEN it refuses `DIAGRAM_PLOTS_DATA` naming the package, and no `latexmk` call occurs

#### Scenario: An unreachable results path fails independently

- GIVEN a source with no plotting package but a path construct pointing into a results tree
- WHEN `render` runs
- THEN the compile fails, distinct from `DIAGRAM_PLOTS_DATA`

### Requirement: No-Skip Test Evidence

The suite MUST run three tiers unconditionally: fixture-driven log parsing,
a stubbed `latexmk` on an injected `PATH` proving invocation shape, and an
emptied `PATH` proving the absence refusal. A genuine end-to-end compile MUST
report `unmeasured` where it did not run, never a pass.

#### Scenario: Every tier runs on a machine without TeX

- GIVEN a test machine with no `latexmk` installed
- WHEN the suite runs
- THEN all three tiers execute and none is skipped

#### Scenario: An unmeasured real compile never reads as a pass

- GIVEN no real `latexmk` distribution available in this environment
- WHEN the end-to-end scenario is evaluated
- THEN its result is `unmeasured`, not `ok`

### Requirement: Fixture Log Provenance

Committed `latexmk` log fixtures MUST be raw bytes captured from a real
compile, never hand-authored, so the parser cannot pass against a fixture
shaped by the same hand that wrote it.

#### Scenario: A fixture carries its capture provenance

- GIVEN a committed fixture log
- WHEN its provenance is inspected
- THEN it records the real `latexmk` invocation that produced it
